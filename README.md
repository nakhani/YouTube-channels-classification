# Deep Learning Video Classification

This project implements a deep learning model for video classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Keras and TensorFlow.

## Features

- Preprocesses video data and extracts frames.
- Implements a CNN-LSTM model for video classification.
- Trains the model and evaluates its performance.
- Visualizes the model architecture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - os
  - glob
  - cv2 (OpenCV)
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - keras
  - tensorflow
